## Codes for Figure 3

This directory contains the codes to run the simulations for Figure 3.

* `HydrogelsFigure.morpho` sequentially runs all the simulations needed to generate the panels in Figure 3.
* `PlotHydrogelFigure.morpho` generates all the graphic panels in Figure 3.

`ConfinedHydrogel.morpho` provides the base classes needed to run the simulations, and is imported by `HydrogelsFigure.morpho`. 
The mesh files provide the starting tetrahedron and spherical meshes.
